# JavaScript Learning Journey

This repository contains my JavaScript learning progress, including:

- **Mini Projects**: Small-scale projects built to apply and reinforce various JavaScript concepts.
- **Practice Files**: Hands-on exercises to improve my skills with functions, objects, DOM manipulation, APIs, and more.
- **Code Snippets**: Useful snippets of JavaScript code Iâ€™ve written while exploring different functionalities.
